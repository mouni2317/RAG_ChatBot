The settlement currency is the currency in which prices are quoted for a particular product, which will typically be the currency in which futures-style settlement variation (mark-to-market) or premium-style option premium amounts are paid or collected.\u00a0When SPAN was first introduced in 1988, usage of 3-byte ISO (International Standards Organization) codes for specifying currencies was not widespread. The standard SPAN file layout therefore used a one-byte code for identifying currencies. In the new, expanded SPAN file layout, the three-byte ISO codes are used.\u00a0The following table gives currencies with both their one-byte and three-byte ISO codes."
