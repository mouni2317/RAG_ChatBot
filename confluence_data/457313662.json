The Daily Adjustment may be thought of as having two components: </span></p><ul><li><p><span>first, the cost of rolling the end-of-day net position from the current business day to the next business day, using today's Daily Adjustment Rate; </span></p></li><li><p><span>second, and only if any as-of trades were cleared today, for each such trade, the cost of rollingeachsuchtradefromthetradedatetothecurrentdate. Theseratesarecalledthe Cumulative Adjustment Rates. </span></p><p><span>An &quot;as-of&quot; trade is any trade with a trade date earlier than the cleared date. As-of's typically arise from floor trades which are matched after the trade date, from giveups which are matched after the allocation date, or from transfers. </span></p><p><span>If your accounts to be margined cleared any as-of trades on a specific date, PC-SPAN allows you to enter the details of these as-of trades, so that you can calculate Daily Adjustment amounts taking into account both of these components of the total cash flow. </span></p><p><span>For Non-QIB accounts: </span></p><p><span>TRAKRS positions in accounts not qualifying for treatment as QIB's have a special method for calculating the SPAN performance bond requirement called the &quot;Value Maintenance Method&quot;. </span></p><p><span>This method provides a parameterized way of: </span></p><ul><li><p><span>setting the margin requirement for each open purchase trade at 100% of the trade price, and </span></p><p><span>setting the margin requirement for each open sale trade at 50% of the trade price, but allowing the requirement for these sale trades to be reset to 50% of the current market price if the margin requirement calculated earlier drops below 30% of the current market price or climbs above 70% of the current market price. </span></p><p><span>In addition, the Open Trade Equity resulting from these open purchase or sale TRAKRS trades is treated differently than the Open Trade Equity from normal futures. It is considered to be &quot;locked- up equity&quot;, and will result neither in the ability to withdraw collateral (if a gain) nor a call for more collateral (if a loss). </span></p><p><span>\u00a0</span>\u00a0</p></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\"><div class=\"layoutArea\"><div class=\"column\"><p><span>For example, if a non-QIB customer buys a TRAKR at 25, and the future settles that day at 26, the performance bond requirement is $25 (100% of the trade price.) $25 in collateral must be deposited, even though there is $1 in Open Trade Equity, because all of this dollar is Locked-Up Equity. Analogously, if the future settled at 24, still only $25 in collateral must be posted, even though there is a negative $1 in OTE, because all of that OTE is locked-up. </span></p><p><span>So for each TRAKRS position in a non-QIB account, PC-SPAN requires you to specify the details of all open trades which together give rise to that net position, with the original trade date, trade price, and open quantity for each. Based upon this information, PC-SPAN will (a) calculate the performance bond requirement using the Value Maintenance method, (b) calculate the Locked- Up Equity, and (c) take the Locked-Up Equity into account in determining the Excess or Deficit amount. </span></p><h2 id=\"UsingPC-SPANversion4.02forTRAKRS-FileFormatConsiderations\"><span>File Format Considerations </span></h2><p><span>The CME currently publishes its SPAN files in both the &quot;standard&quot; unpacked and packed formats, in use since 1988, and in the newer and more flexible XML-based format, available since 1999. </span></p><p><span>Both the standard-format files and the XML-based format files contain the special &quot;Value Maintenance Rates&quot; data which identify the TRAKRS products as such, and which drive the calculation of the SPAN requirement for non-QIB accounts for these products. </span></p><p><span>For the Daily Adjustment rates, the standard-format SPAN files contain only the current day's rate, whereas the XML-based SPAN file contains all daily and cumulative rates since the TRAKRS began trading. </span></p><p><span>So if you are using one of the standard-format SPAN files, and if you wish to calculate Daily Adjustment cash flow amounts for QIB accounts </span><span>which cleared as-of trades </span><span>today, then you must obtain the Daily Adjustment History file </span><span>in addition to </span><span>the standard-format SPAN file.
