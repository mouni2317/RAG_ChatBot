For example, at the CME, the Eurodollar combined commodity encompasses Mid-Curve options, Eurodollars and Eurodollar options.\u00a0 To view the complete listing of Combined Commodities, refer to the Combined Commodities report under the Risk Parameters folder.</p><p><strong>Level:</strong>\u00a0 The breakdown of the scanning risk calculations for net and gross portfolios.\u00a0 The scan scenario is shown as net for a net portfolio, but\u00a0 for a gross portfolio scan risk calculations are categorized by inter, intra and naked.</p><p><strong>Class:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </strong>Specifies the different levels of performance bond requirements.\u00a0 This allows an exchange or clearing organization to divide its performance bond requirement into different, acceptable forms of collateral.</p><p><strong>Maint/Init:</strong>\u00a0\u00a0 Identifies whether a performance bond requirement is a Maintenance Requirement or an Initial Requirement.</p><p><strong>Tier No.:\u00a0 </strong>A tier is a set of consecutive contract expirations for one Combined Commodity.\u00a0 The tier number refers to a series of contract expirations within a tier.\u00a0 Overall is used to identify all contract expirations in a Combined Commodity.</p><p><strong>Scan Risk:\u00a0 </strong>The per contract risk calculation Span generates to identify the greatest loss from a Combined Commodity under one of the Risk Array calculations.</p><p><strong>Active Scenario:</strong></p><p>The number of the Risk Array Scenario that caused the greatest loss for each Combined Commodity is shown, along with it's assumptions for price, volatility and weighted futures price risk.\u00a0 In the case of the above example, for the Combined Commodity EC, the Active Scenario is Scenario 11.\u00a0 (Note:\u00a0 in Span, losses are viewed as positive values, and gains as negative values).</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p><p>This is a view of the Risk Array Scenarios utilized by Span (there are sixteen standard arrays, although greater or fewer arrays may be used).\u00a0 Each Scenario reflects the hypothetical gain/loss for the position in a Combined Commodity under specified market conditions.\u00a0 The scenarios assume a change in the price and volatility of the underlying instrument.\u00a0 For example, for Combined Commodity EC in the above report, scenario 5 assumes that the underlying price is down 1/3 of the price scan range, volatility up the full volatility scan range percentage and a scenario weight of 100%, which means to apply 100% of the gain or loss total.</p><p><strong>Scenario Total:</strong></p><p>The gain or loss associated with each Scenario - again, losses are expressed as positive values, gains as negative values.\u00a0\u00a0 For example, for Combined Commodity EC in the above report, scenario 15 assumes that the underlying price is up 3 times the full price scan range, no volatility (at zero on the scan range percentage scale) and a scenario weight of 30%, which means to apply 30% of the gain or loss total.</p><p>\u00a0</p>"
