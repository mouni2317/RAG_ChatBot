or &quot;extension&quot; -- will be\u00a0<strong>.spn</strong>.\u00a0 The default name for your SPAN document, which you can accept or change, is\u00a0<strong>span.spn</strong>.</p><p>(When you install PC-SPAN, the\u00a0<strong>.spn</strong>\u00a0filetype is &quot;registered&quot; with Windows.\u00a0 So Windows knows that any file that has a name ending in\u00a0<strong>.spn</strong>\u00a0is a SPAN document.\u00a0 If you're in Windows Explorer, for example, if you double-click on a SPAN document, PC-SPAN version 4 will be launched and that SPAN document will be opened in it.)</p><p>You can have as many SPAN documents as you want stored on your disk(s), named any way you want.\u00a0 At any time, if you want to resume working with a SPAN document saved on disk, you can either:</p><ul><li>Using Windows Explorer or similar program, find the SPAN document file and execute it.\u00a0\u00a0 As indicated above, PC-SPAN version 4 will be launched, and the selected SPAN document opened within it.</li><li>From within PC-SPAN version 4, select the &quot;File Open&quot; command from the menu, or just click on the &quot;Open&quot; button in the toolbar.\u00a0 The &quot;Open&quot; dialog box will display.\u00a0 Find the desired SPAN document file, and either double click on it, or select it and then click on the &quot;Open&quot; button in the dialog.</li></ul><p>By default, PC-SPAN version 4 will save your SPAN documents in the\u00a0<strong>data</strong>\u00a0subdirectory of the main directory where the program is installed.\u00a0 You can save SPAN documents anywhere, however.</p><p>PC-SPAN version 4 has a &quot;single document interface&quot;.\u00a0 You can have only one document open at a time in a copy of PC-SPAN 4.\u00a0 You can have as many copies of PC-SPAN running at the same time as you want, however.\u00a0 For example, if you want to work on a new SPAN document without closing the one you're currently working on, just start another copy of PC-SPAN.</p><p>Suppose you have a SPAN document already open in PC-SPAN 4, and you have made some changes to that document since you last saved it.\u00a0 If you now tell PC-SPAN 4 to open a new document, it will ask you whether you want to save the current document, before clearing it out of memory and loading the new document.</p><h2 id=\"UsePC-SPAN-WorkingintheDatawindow\">Working in the Data window</h2><p>When you work in the Data window, you will see your SPAN data arranged in a\u00a0<strong>&quot;tree view.&quot;</strong>\u00a0 This works very much like the tree view in Windows Explorer and many other programs.\u00a0 You see your data in a hierarchical structure.</p><p>If you see a data element -- called a &quot;node&quot; -- which has a plus sign (&quot;+&quot;) to the left of it, that means that the node is expandible.\u00a0 Click on the plus sign to\u00a0<strong>expand</strong>\u00a0the node, to see the data beneath it.\u00a0 When the node is expanded, the symbol will change to the minus sign (&quot;-&quot;).\u00a0 Click on the minus sign to\u00a0<strong>contract</strong>\u00a0the node -- to make the data beneath it invisible again.</p><p>You can use the keyboard to work with the tree view if you choose.\u00a0 Simply use the\u00a0<strong>Up</strong>\u00a0arrow and the\u00a0<strong>Down\u00a0</strong>arrow to browse up or down.\u00a0 If you are on a node which is expandible, press the\u00a0<strong>Right</strong>\u00a0arrow to expand it, or the\u00a0<strong>Left</strong>\u00a0arrow to contract it.</p><p>Some data items on the tree -- for example -- portfolios, or contracts, -- have &quot;Properties&quot; dialog boxes associated with them.\u00a0 You can bring up the dialog box associated with an item in several different ways.\u00a0 If the item is selected, press either\u00a0<strong>Enter\u00a0</strong>or\u00a0<strong>Alt-Enter</strong>.\u00a0 Or you can\u00a0<strong>double click</strong>\u00a0on the item.\u00a0 Or you can single click on the item to select it, right-click on it to bring up its associated &quot;object&quot; menu, and then select &quot;Properties.&quot;</p><p>The structure of the data in the tree view is as follows:</p><ul><li>At the very top level, you'll see a node for the\u00a0<strong>overall SPAN document</strong>.</li><li>Beneath this, there will be nodes for each\u00a0<strong>point in time</strong>\u00a0for which any data has been loaded.</li><li>For each point in time, you will see two overall sections, one for\u00a0<strong>portfolios\u00a0</strong>defined at that point in time, and another for\u00a0<strong>exchange complexes</strong>\u00a0for which data is loaded for that point in time.</li></ul><h2 id=\"UsePC-SPAN-Basicoperations:OpeningandsavingSPANdocuments,andloadingSPANriskparameterfiles\">Basic operations:\u00a0 Opening and saving SPAN documents, and loading SPAN risk parameter files</h2><ul><li>To load data from a SPAN risk parameter file into the current SPAN document:\u00a0 click on the Load button on the toolbar, or select File Load from the menu, or press Ctrl-L.\u00a0 The Load File dialog box will display.\u00a0 Select the file to be loaded, and click Open.\u00a0 The selected file is loaded.<strong><br/></strong></li><li><strong>To open a SPAN document previously saved to disk:</strong>\u00a0 Click the\u00a0<strong>Open</strong>\u00a0button on the toolbar, or select\u00a0<strong>File Open</strong>\u00a0from the menu, or press\u00a0<strong>Ctrl-O</strong>.\u00a0 The\u00a0<strong>Open\u00a0</strong>dialog box displays.\u00a0 Select the SPAN document you wish to open -- the filename will end with\u00a0<strong>.spn</strong>\u00a0-- and click the\u00a0<strong>Open</strong>\u00a0button.
