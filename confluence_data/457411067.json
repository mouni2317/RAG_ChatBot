following:</p><ul><li>Click on the\u00a0<strong>New Portfolio</strong>\u00a0button on the toolbar.</li><li>Press\u00a0<strong>Ctrl-F</strong>, the keyboard shortcut for new portfolio.</li><li>Select\u00a0<strong>File</strong>\u00a0and then\u00a0<strong>New Portfolio</strong>\u00a0from the menu.</li><li>Select the\u00a0<strong>Portfolios</strong>\u00a0node on the tree view, and then press\u00a0<strong>Insert</strong>.</li><li>Select the\u00a0<strong>Portfolios</strong>\u00a0node on the tree view,\u00a0<strong>right-click</strong>\u00a0on the node, and then select\u00a0<strong>New Portfolio</strong>\u00a0from the menu that pops up.</li></ul><p>If you're using the button on the toolbar or the selection from the menu, and if there is more than one point in time defined in the current SPAN document, a dialog box will display so that you can select the point in time for which the portfolio should be created.</p><p>The portfolio dialog box will now display, and you can start entering data for the portfolio.\u00a0 When you are done, click on the\u00a0<strong>OK</strong>\u00a0button (or press\u00a0<strong>Enter</strong>) to save the portfolio.\u00a0 (If you change your mind and don't want to save the portfolio, just select the\u00a0<strong>Cancel</strong>\u00a0button.)</p><h3 id=\"DefiningPortfolios-WorkingwiththePortfolioDialogBox\">Working with the Portfolio Dialog Box</h3><p>The Portfolio dialog box has\u00a0the following\u00a0tabs:</p><ul><li><strong>Portfolio</strong>\u00a0-- for maintaining overall information about the portfolio -- for example, its account number or ledger balance</li><li><strong>Positions</strong>\u00a0-- for viewing or defining the positions in the portfolio</li><li><strong>Performance Bond Requirements</strong>\u00a0-- for viewing the performance bond requirements for the portfolio, once they have been calculated</li><li><strong>Values</strong>\u00a0-- for viewing the overall values of futures-style products and premium-style products in the portfolio.</li></ul><p>Like any tabbed dialog box, you can switch among the different tabs either by clicking on the tab, or by pressing\u00a0<strong>Ctrl-Tab</strong>.\u00a0 For example, you can quickly move from the portfolio tab to the positions tab by pressing\u00a0<strong>Ctrl-Tab</strong>, and you can quickly return to the portfolio tab by pressing\u00a0<strong>Shift-Ctrl-Tab</strong>.</p><p>After making any changes to the portfolio -- either on the portfolio tab or the positions tab -- be sure to select\u00a0<strong>OK</strong>\u00a0if you want the portfolio data to be updated.\u00a0 The portfolio data will not be updated until and less you do this.</p><h3 id=\"DefiningPortfolios-DefiningOverallPortfolioData\">Defining Overall Portfolio Data</h3><p>Here's what you can specify on the portfolio tab:</p><ul><li><strong>Parent account:</strong>\u00a0 if you are defining a portfolio which is a subaccount of an omnibus account, select the parent omnibus account here.\u00a0 Except for such subaccounts, this field should be left blank.</li><li><strong>Clearing firm</strong>:\u00a0 provide a value -- any value -- to identify the clearing firm.</li><li><strong>Account:</strong>\u00a0 provide a value -- any value -- to identify the specific account at that firm, or accept the default value of &quot;*** New Portfolio ***&quot;.</li><li><strong>Account type</strong>:\u00a0 select from any of the available account types.\u00a0 Account types are either\u00a0<strong>customer-level</strong>\u00a0-- for accounts held on the books of a clearing member firm -- or\u00a0<strong>clearing-level</strong>\u00a0-- for clearing firm accounts on the books of a clearing organization.\u00a0 Customer-level account types currently defined are\u00a0<strong>member, hedger, speculator,\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>omnibus</strong>.\u00a0 Clearing-level account types currently defined are\u00a0<strong>normal</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>member</strong>.</li><li><strong>Segregation type</strong>:\u00a0 if you wish, you can identify the specific\u00a0<strong>segregation type</strong>\u00a0(also called the\u00a0<strong>origin</strong>) of the account.\u00a0 Currently defined segregation types are\u00a0<strong>CUST</strong>\u00a0for customer, or\u00a0<strong>HOUS</strong>\u00a0for house (<em>ie</em>, proprietary.)\u00a0 If you choose not to identify the specific segregation type of an account, leave this field at its default value of\u00a0<strong>N/A\u00a0</strong>(not applicable.)</li><li><strong>Portfolio currency:</strong>\u00a0 select the currency in which the overall performance bond requirement for this account will be denominated.</li><li><strong>Ledger Balance</strong>,\u00a0<strong>Open Trade Equity</strong>, and\u00a0<strong>Securities on Deposit</strong>:<strong>\u00a0\u00a0</strong>provide the values, denominated in the specified portfolio currency, for these collateral assets for the account.\u00a0 Generally, these fields are used as follows:<br/>\u00a0<ul><li><strong>Ledger Balance</strong>\u00a0contains the cash balance in the account not associated with open positions in futures-style products.</li><li><strong>Open Trade Equity</strong>\u00a0contains the cash balance associated with open positions in futures-style products.</li><li><strong>Securities on Deposit</strong>\u00a0contains the haircutted performance bond value associated with non-cash collateral assets such as debt or equity securities.</li></ul></li></ul><p>You'll note several improvements here over previous PC-SPAN versions:</p><ul><li>Firm and account identifiers can be any (reasonable) length.</li><li>Within a point in time, portfolios are made unique by their firm identifier, account identifier\u00a0<strong>and\u00a0</strong>segregation type.\u00a0 If you need to define two different accounts, which have the same firm and account ID's but different segtypes, you can now do this.</li><li>You can change the firm and account identifiers at any time.</li><li>You can specify different currencies in which the overall performance bond requirement should be denominated, for different portfolios.\u00a0 They don't all have to be the same.</li></ul>"
